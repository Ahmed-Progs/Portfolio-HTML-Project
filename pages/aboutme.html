<h1>About me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I am a dedicated and passionate web developer with a solid foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. My
    focus lies in building responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites that deliver seamless experiences
    across devices. With experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap and React, I enjoy turning
    ideas into clean, efficient, and engaging digital solutions.</p>
<p>Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on a range of projects — from static landing pages to dynamic, database-driven
    applications. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and paying close attention to detail, ensuring every
    project meets both technical standards and user expectations. I believe that a successful website isn’t just about
    how it looks, but how well it works and how intuitively users can interact with it.</p>
<p>I’m continuously expanding my skill set, staying updated with the latest web trends and best practices. I’m
    passionate about learning new technologies and tackling fresh challenges that push me to grow both as a developer
    and a problem-solver. My ultimate goal is to create digital experiences that are functional, meaningful, and
    enjoyable for everyone who uses them.
